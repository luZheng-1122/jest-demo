# jest-demo
Hi there, this is a simple demo of unit-testing in react with jest. Learn from: [testing-javascrpt](https://github.com/kentcdodds/testing-workshop)

## Get Started
The demo invovles [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), [jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
### setup

1. yarn

```
brew install yarn
yarn init
```

2. jest

```
yarn add --dev jest
```
Add the following section to your package.json:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

3. react

Since this demo is more about testing, so it does not include react setup.

### install babel
```
yarn add --dev babel-core babel-preset-env
```
then add ".babelrc":
```
{
    "presets" : ["env"]
}
```


## Simple Start

Let's create a .js file and write a normal function, in our case, a 'sum.js' file in root directory.
```
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;
```

Then, create a directory called `__test__`, and create a file named sum.test.js.
```
const sum = require('../sum'); //pay attention to the path

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Finally, run **yarn test** to get our test result:
```
$ jest
 PASS  __test__/sum.test.js
  âœ“ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (7ms)
```

## code coverage
> code coverage is basically about how much our code is been run.
```
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest --coverage",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch" //watch mode to quickly respond to your change
  }
```

if some files are not been imported at all, jest will report that as well, but need to add this:

```
"jest": {
    "collectCoverageFrom": [
      "*.js"
    ]
  }
```

## unit testing
unit testing is for testing a single function whether could return a expected result.
you need to write test case for every possible conditions and give the input and the expected output.

## end-to-end test
> End-to-end testing is a methodology used to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish. The purpose of carrying out end-to-end tests is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the right information is passed between various system components and systems.

### install [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#npm-install)
```
npm install cypress --save-dev
```
and open it:
```
$(npm bin)/cypress open
```

### smoke test

> Smoke testing covers most of the major functions of the software but none of them in depth. The result of this test is used to decide whether to proceed with further testing. If the smoke test passes, go ahead with further testing. If it fails, halt further tests and ask for a new build with the required fixes. If an application is badly broken, detailed testing might be a waste of time and effort.

Examples of smoke test: 
1. title
1. page route


### post_spec test
> test for 'post functions'

### user_spec test
> test from user's prospective, need to think of what kinds of things does a user do that we want to make sure the system doesn't break?

Examples of user_spec test: 
1. verify login
1. modify profile
